 Infiltrator: You are not affected by quality or Tier when you bypass security measures.
 Ambush: When you attack from hiding or spring a trap, you get +1d.
 Daredevil: When you roll a desperate action, you get +1d to your roll if you also take -1d to any resistance rolls against consequences from your action.
 The Devil's Footsteps: When you push yourself, choose one 
of the following additional benefits: perform a feat of athletics that verges on the superhuman—maneuver to confuse your enemies so they 
mistakenly attack each other.
 Expertise: Choose one of your action ratings. When you lead a 
group action using that action, you can suffer only 1 stress at most regardless of the number of failed rolls.
 Ghost Veil: You may shift partially into the ghost field, becoming shadowy and insubstantial for a few moments. Take 2 stress when 
you shift, plus 1 stress for each extra feature: It lasts for a few minutes rather than moments—you are invisible rather than shadowy—you 
may float through the air like a ghost
 Reflexes: When there's a question about who acts first, the answer 
is you (two characters with Reflexes act simultaneously).
 Shadow: You may expend your special armor to resist a consequence 
from detection or security measures, or to push yourself for a feat 
of athletics or stealth.
   Veteran: Choose a special ability from another source
